Cheese: In the future, please don't include a file path [e.g. read.csv("cheese1.csv") instead of read.csv("https://dahl.byu.edu/223/2018a2/hw/01/files/cheese1.csv")]. This code doesn't work on my machine because my file structure isn't the same as yours. Just make sure that the .csv files are in the same folder as the script and it will run fine. Please print out the answers instead of putting the answers in the comments. (10)

Clothes: I see that you put a lot of effort into this, which is awesome, but 
some of the output is incorrect for the last section. I would recommend utilizing
R's nice vectorization features. For example, 3-5 lines of code can remove the rows
for which Price is not available, change it to numeric with no dollar signs, and
extract the standard deviations for the last part. Utilize apply statements and
subsetting. Come into the TA hours to get more help with this! Good job. (8)

Fibonacci: Close! The output is incorrect for n > 2, but you have the right
idea. The Fibonacci numbers are 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13...

Talk to Dr. Dahl about your current file structure...you'll need to run this code again (source("https://dahl.byu.edu/223/2018a2/setup2.R")) and push these files up to the repository.
